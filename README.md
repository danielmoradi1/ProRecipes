This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## ProRecipes is an application for searching recipes using Edamam's API. It uses React, Next.js, Bootstrap and Axios.

Functions
- Search recipes: Users can search for recipes using a search field.
- Show results: List of matching recipes is displayed.
- Recipe details: Click on a recipe to see details, ingredients and instructions.

Folder structure
- pages: Contains page components, including dynamic recipe pages.
- src/app: Contains API management with Axios.
- src/components: Contains components for recipe list, detail view and search field.
- style: Contains CSS files for styling.

Bootstrap is used for responsive design and Axios for API calls.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
